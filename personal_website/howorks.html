            <h3>How works the algorithm of Instagram?</h3>
            <p>Since 2020 the algorithm of Instagram 
                switch to famous videos called “reels” 
                and left out the photos because the reels 
                are searched by algorithms around the world 
                while people that find your profile will see 
                your photos. If you want to grow your business 
                inside of this social media, just upload reels 
                as most as possible. I recommend this video from 
                my YouTube channel to know more about this topic.</p>

            <h3>How works the algorithm of YouTube?</h3>
            <p>The algorithm of YouTube turns around 
                how much time people spend seeing your 
                video. So, if you have a video of 10 
                minutes but the people just see 2 or 
                3 minutes, is less probably that YouTube 
                shares your content with other people. 
                The algorithm thinks that your video is 
                a little boring. But if you have a video 
                of 5 minutes and the majority of people 
                see 2 or 3 minutes, so the algorithm will 
                share your content. It thinks that your 
                video is very interesting for the people in 
                that niche. To know more about that, I 
                recommend this video from my personal 
                profile on YouTube.</p>

            <h3>How works the algorithm of TikTok?</h3>
            <p>TikTok is now ranked as one of the best 
                algorithms of all social networks, which 
                means "TikTok" can satisfy users by recommending 
                interesting videos in a fast way. Our goal is 
                that each user sees your full video, if that 
                happens the algorithm will find your video 
                interesting and share it with other users. 
                The key is to create a hook in the first 
                few seconds of the video so that the user 
                sees the entire video. See this video from 
                my YouTube channel to know more about that.</p>
