                    <h3>How works the algorithm of Instagram?</h3>
                    <p>Since 2020 the algorithm of Instagram
                        switch to famous videos called “reels”
                        and left out the photos because the reels
                        are searched by algorithms around the world
                        while people that find your profile will see
                        your photos. If you want to grow your business
                        inside of this social media, just upload reels
                        as most as possible. I recommend this video from
                        my YouTube channel to know more about this topic.</p>

                    <h3>How works the algorithm of YouTube?</h3>
                    <p>The algorithm of YouTube turns around
                        how much time people spend seeing your
                        video. So, if you have a video of 10
                        minutes but the people just see 2 or
                        3 minutes, is less probably that YouTube
                        shares your content with other people.
                        The algorithm thinks that your video is
                        a little boring. But if you have a video
                        of 5 minutes and the majority of people
                        see 2 or 3 minutes, so the algorithm will
                        share your content. It thinks that your
                        video is very interesting for the people in
                        that niche. To know more about that, I
                        recommend this video from my personal
                        profile on YouTube.</p>

                    <h3>How works the algorithm of TikTok?</h3>
                    <p>TikTok is now ranked as one of the best
                        algorithms of all social networks, which
                        means "TikTok" can satisfy users by recommending
                        interesting videos in a fast way. Our goal is
                        that each user sees your full video, if that
                        happens the algorithm will find your video
                        interesting and share it with other users.
                        The key is to create a hook in the first
                        few seconds of the video so that the user
                        sees the entire video. See this video from
                        my YouTube channel to know more about that.</p>
