            <p>See your stats to know the average of people who sees the video complete,
                if your average is over 50%, you are in a good way.

            <p>
                The content evergreen will help you to get views through the years,
                the videos categorized as “evergreen” there are content that people
                keep searching for regardless of the season. For example, videos that
                explain “how to write a website?” or “how to create a YouTube channel?”.
                Sensational content will attract views for a certain season, maybe a couple
                of months at most, but in the end, people will stop looking for it and no
                one will continue to watch your video.

            <p>
                Be patient, the progress takes time, the best thing you can do is made feedback to know what you can
                improve in your content.

            <summary>On what social networks I can earn a better income of money?</summary>
            <p>
                In my opinion, YouTube, because in Tiktok you need to be one of the most famous to get income,
                in Instagram is similar to Tiktok, it depends a lot on the brand that wants to sponsor
                you and for a brand to sponsor you you need a good number of followers for not say millions.
                Instead, on YouTube, you can easily earn money through advertising on your video for every
                view your channel receives.
